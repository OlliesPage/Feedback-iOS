    "description": "This is a model of feedback system with limits. By moving the sliders you can adjust the input I and disturbance D. By tapping the block parameters they also can be adjusted, this includes the limiting block. The line in the limit block turns red to help indicate when the systems limit has been reached, this can be useful when a disturbance has been applied.\n\nBy using the sine graph and setting the limit block to a low value you can see how limits can be used to generate square waves from sine waves."
